1. Average Number of Successes
Both simulated and theoretical values center around 850 successes. This matches the expected value n*p = 1000 * 0.85.

2. Closeness to Theoretical Distribution
The histogram closely follows the bell-shaped curve of a Binomial distribution.

The standard deviation is small (~11.2), indicating high consistency.

3. Reliability of Simulation in Trials
With large sample sizes and repeated simulations, the law of large numbers ensures the empirical results converge to the theoretical.

Hence, simulation is a powerful and reliable tool in modeling vaccine efficacy outcomes before or during real-world trials.

Helps evaluate risk, variability, and confidence intervals.
