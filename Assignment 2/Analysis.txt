Q1. How frequently do call volumes exceed 7 per hour?
From simulation: ~9% of hours had > 7 calls/hour

Indicates rare spikes — may require extra staff on standby.

Q2. What are the chances of getting 0 calls?
Theoretical Poisson PMF:

P(0 \text{ calls}) = e^{-4} \approx 0.0183 \text{ (1.83%)}
So very few hours are fully idle.

Q3. Staffing Plan
Minimum: Staff for handling 3–5 calls/hour (most common).

Flexible backup: For 8–10 call hours (~10% of time), on-call/overflow staff needed.

Automation: During low-call hours (e.g. 0–1 calls), chatbots or auto-responders can reduce workload.
