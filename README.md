# 🎲 Probability Distributions Simulation in Python & C

This project simulates **Binomial**, **Poisson**, and **Normal** distributions using both **C** and **Python**, and visualizes the results using Python libraries.

Each distribution:
- Simulates random events using defined parameters.
- Outputs results to a `.csv` file.
- Manually calculates **mean** and **standard deviation**.
- Provides plots for analysis and understanding.

> 📌 This project is created as a Mathematics + Programming assignment to showcase simulation, statistical computation, and data visualization.
