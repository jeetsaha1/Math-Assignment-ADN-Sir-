1. Gifted and Challenged Categories
Approximately 2.2% of individuals had an IQ ≤ 70 (challenged).

Around 2.1% had an IQ ≥ 130 (gifted).

These percentages align with the tails of the normal distribution.

2. Empirical Rule Verification
We verified the 68-95-99.7 rule:

~68% of IQs lie between 85 and 115 (±1σ)

~95% between 70 and 130 (±2σ)

~99.7% between 55 and 145 (±3σ)

These values matched the theoretical expectations for a normal distribution.

3. Effect of Standard Deviation
Increasing σ (e.g., to 20) increases the spread—more people in the outlier zones.

Decreasing σ (e.g., to 10) concentrates the values closer to the mean.
